Building Domain Index
_____________________

Creating a domain specific index involves:

- Uploading known relevant URL domains from which you would like to collect all URLs belonging to that domain. This is called a deep crawl. Follow steps 1,2 and 4, below, for this.
- Create a domain model that can be used for a focused crawl (broad crawl). For this follow all the steps 1-4 below.

Step 1
~~~~~~

.. include:: add_domain.rst

Step 2

.. include:: load_data.rst

Step 3

Step 3a
