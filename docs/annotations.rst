Annotate Pages
--------------

A model is created by annotating pages as **Relevant** or **Irrelevant** for the domain. Currently, the model can only distinguish between relevant and irrelevant pages. You can also annotate pages with custom tags. These can be later grouped as relevant or irrelevant when generating the model. Try to alternate between Steps 3a and 3b to build a model till you reach at least 100 pages for each. This will continuously build a model and you can see the accuracy of the model at the top right corner - **Domain Model Accuracy**.
